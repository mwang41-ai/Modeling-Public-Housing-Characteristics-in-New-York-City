# Modeling-Public-Housing-Characteristics-in-New-York-City

I chose the NYCHA public housing variable to examine the research question: What differentiates NYCHA public housing from other subsidized housing? Using the variables year built, residential units, assessed value per unit, and net rental income, I want to understand how public versus private housing programs produce different building forms and values in New York City’s affordable housing landscape. 

I applied Kendall’s Tau instead of Pearson’s R for correlation tests since the variables are categorical. Between NYCHA and year built, there is a statistically significant yet weak negative relationship, which suggests that NYCHA buildings were built earlier than other subsidized housing developments. Between NYCHA and residential units, there is a statistically significant and positive relationship, which suggests that NYCHA buildings are generally larger with more units, compared to other subsidized housing. Between NYCHA and assessed value per unit, there is a significant negative relationship, which suggests that NYCHA buildings have lower per unit values compared to other subsidized housing. Between NYCHA and net rental income, there is no meaningful statistical relationship since p-value is greater than 0.05, which suggests that NYCHA buildings do not earn more or less rental income than other subsidized housing.

A map was made to highlight the location of NYCHA buildings. A majority of them are located near East Harlem, Chinatown, and Ocean Hill. 

In the logistic model, year_built is statistically significant with a p-value less than 5%. It has a negative coefficient, in which newer buildings are associated with lower logit of being NYCHA. The odd ratio shows that for each additional year of construction, the odds of being a NYCHA development decrease by 0.5%. This means older buildings are more likely to be NYCHA developments. Res_units is statistically significant with a p-value less than 5%. It has a positive coefficient, in which buildings with more units are associated with higher logit of being NYCHA. The odd ratio shows that for each additional unit, the odds of being a NYCHA development increase by 0.3%.  Net_inc_sqft is less statistically significant compared to others but the p-value is still less than 5%. It has a negative coefficient, in which buildings with higher net rental income per sq ft are associated with lower logit of being NYCHA. The odd ratio shows that for each $1 increase, the odds of being NYCHA development decrease by 0.23%. Assessed_value_perunit is statistically significant with a p-value less than 5%. It has a negative coefficient, in which buildings with high value are associated with lower logit of being NYCHA, however, that margin is very small. The odd ratio shows that for each $1 increase, the odds of being NYCHA development stays the same. Thus, the value of NYCHA units is similar to that of other subsidized housing units. 

Based on AIC values, the model using net_inc_sqft appears to fit best. The models for res_units and assessed_value_perunit perform moderately well, while year_built has the weakest AIC out of the four predictors. However, when examining deviance, res_units is the strongest predictor, followed by assessed_value_perunit. Both year_built and net_inc_sqft produced only modest deviance improvement. Although net_inc_sqft shows the smallest deviance drop, it yields the lowest AIC. This is because AIC is based on the final model deviance rather than the size of the deviance reduction, and the model for net_inc_sqft is estimated on a smaller subset of the data due to missing values. Therefore, despite its favorable AIC, the deviance results indicate that net_inc_sqft lacks explanatory power in determining NYCHA development.

I excluded res_units from the multivariate logic regression model to resolve estimation warnings. In the final model, all three predictors, year_built, net_inc_sqft, and assessed_value_perunit are statistically significant with low p-values. The intercept represents the value of outcome when all predictors equal to 0, but this value is not interpretable because the predictors here do not reflect the conditions of a real building (0 year, 0 value, 0 income). 

In this multivariate model, year_built and assessed_value_perunit both have positive coefficients and associated with a positive relationship on NYCHA development, meaning that newer buildings have a higher logit of being NYCHA development and buildings with higher values have a slightly higher logit of being NYCHA development. This is a reversal from the one-predictor models (where both coefficients were negative), which suggests the presence of confounders among predictors. Once income and assessed value are controlled, the remaining variation in year_built reveals that, among buildings with similar income and value levels, some newer buildings are indeed NYCHA. A similar suppression effect appears for assessed value, and among buildings with similar age and income profiles, NYCHA buildings can sometimes have slightly higher assessed values per unit. Net_inc_sqft has a negative coefficient, in which buildings with higher income per sq ft are associated with lower logits of being NYCHA when age and assessed value are held constant. Overall, the model achieves a strong AIC score, indicating improved model performance compared to single-predictor model. 

The 95% positive confidence interval for year_built lies above 1, which suggests that for every additional year, the odds of being a NYCHA development increase between 0.37% and 1.12%. The 95% negative confidence interval for net_inc_sqft lies below 1, which suggests that for each additional $1, the odds of being a NYCHA development decrease between 2.6% and 6.6%. The 95% positive confidence interval for assessed_value_perunit lies slightly above 1, which suggests that for each additional $1, the odds of being a NYCHA development increase very slightly between 0.0002% and 0.0007%. 

Finally, the null model started with a deviance of 1628.8, and the full multivariate model’s deviance decreased to 1598.4. Among the three predictors, net_inc_sqft contributes the largest reduction in deviance within the multivariate context, making it the strongest predictor in this combined model, even though it was weak in the one-predictor models, and it explains more of the remaining differences between NYCHA and non-NYCHA buildings than other variables.
